Technical interview assignment.

***Disclaimer:***
*The goal of this exercise is to challenge myself as a developer to reproduce this app. I am NOT claiming ownership for design and/or product. The original design was shared and likely created by Messias Cole.*

## 1. Configure project manually
* Initiated project with yarn.
* Added React and ReactDOM.
* Created .gitignore file and added "/node_modules" to it.
* Added Webpack packages: webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server. 
  
  *Note: Going forward wepack will be updated with neccessary loaders (babel, html, css, files...).*

* Created directories: "./src", "./public"; Created files: "app.js", "index.jsx". (/w basic imports and jsx);
* Created "./public/index.html" template file and defined the root element.
* Added Babel packages: @babel/core, @babel/preset-react, @babel/preset-env and babel-loader for webpack. Created .babelrc and assigned the presets.
* Added scripts to start webpack-dev-server and to build the app.
